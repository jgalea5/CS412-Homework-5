# CS412-Homework-5
Project 5 for CS 412 Fall 2018

Project done by Jose Galeano and Alexis Urquiza

We picked option 1 for our homework:

You are working for a non-profit that is recruiting student volunteers to help with Alzheimer’s
patients. You have been tasked with predicting how suitable a person is for this task by predicting how
empathetic he or she is. Using the Young People Survey dataset
*Link*, predict a person’s “Empathy” as either 
“very empathetic” (answers 4 and 5) or “not very empathetic” (answers 1, 2, and 3). You can use any of
the other attributes in the dataset to make this prediction; however, you should not handpick the
predictive features but let an algorithm select them.

The link to the original dataset is provided in the link below. We used the young people survey for homework 5:
